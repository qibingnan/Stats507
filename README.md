## Stats 507

This is a github repository for my work in the course Stats 507, Fall 2021. 

### NHANES datasets

The file [NHANES.py](./NHANES.py) includes the code to read, clean, and preprocess the data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ([NHANES](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm)). The data are from four cohorts spanning the years 2011-2018. After preprocessing, two datasets of feather format, demographic dataset (`demo.feather`) and oral health and dentition dataset (`ohx.feather`) will be saved to the local directory.
